Hi, I'm a freelance full-stack web developer based in Lancashire, UK.

I specialise in building easy-to-use content management systems - with a particular focus on the housing sector - in order to drive leads and sales for my clients.

When I'm not writing code I'm usually watching/thinking/reading about:

- Rallying :car:
- Photography :camera:
- Electronics :battery:
- Amateur radio :radio:
