##### Me me me

Hi :wave:, I'm a freelance full-stack web developer based in Lancashire, UK.

I specialise in building easy-to-use CMS powered websites, with a particular focus on the housing sector, to drive leads and sales for my clients.

I've been making things appear on the web since the '90s when I took my first steps into web development by writing a few lines of HTML in Notepad that resulted in an image of a [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_(series)) character appearing in Internet Explorer. Many [LucasArts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LucasArts) inspired fan sites soon followed once I'd figured out how to actually put text and images online - [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) anyone?

In the 20-odd years since, I've seen plenty of web technologies rise and fall but I continue to strive to keep up to date with the many languages, frameworks and codes of best practice that make up the modern web.

When I'm not writing code I'm usually watching/thinking/reading about:

- Web development :computer:
- Rallying :car:
- Photography :camera:
- Electronics :battery:
- Amateur radio :radio:

##### This website

This site uses the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) concept and is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/). The site deploys from a [git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dmturner/dmturner.co.uk) where it's then built and hosted using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dmturner/deploys).

Continuous deployment means that I can push any changes to the repository and have Netlify automatically detect the change, build the new content and deploy the new code - usually within 30 seconds of me pushing the commits.

All blog post content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which makes it easy to write and style. It's also handy for making sure that the content is future-proof by not being tied to any particular CMS or database.
