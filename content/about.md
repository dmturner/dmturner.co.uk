##### Me me me 

Hi :wave:, I'm a freelance full-stack web developer based in Lancashire, UK.

I specialise in building easy-to-use CMS powered websites - with a particular focus on the housing sector - in order to drive leads and sales for my clients.

When I'm not writing code I'm usually watching/thinking/reading about:

- Web development :computer:
- Rallying :car:
- Photography :camera:
- Electronics :battery:
- Amateur radio :radio:

##### This website

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/). The site deploys from a git [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dmturner/dmturner.co.uk) where it's then built and hosted using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dmturner/deploys).

Continuous deployment means that I can push any changes to the repository and have Netlify automatically detect the change, build and deploy the amends - usually within 30 seconds of me pushing the commits. Awesome!

All blog post content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which makes it easy to write and style content. It's also handy for making sure content is future-proof by not being tied to any particular CMS.
