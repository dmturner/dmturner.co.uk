##### Hello :wave:

I'm David, a freelance full-stack web developer, based in Lancashire in the UK.

With a particular focus on the housing sector, I specialise in building easy-to-use, CMS-powered websites that generate leads and drive sales for my clients. 

I've been making things appear on the web since the '90s, when I took my first steps into web development by writing a few lines of HTML in Notepad and making [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_(series)) images appear in Internet Explorer. Many [LucasArts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LucasArts)-inspired fan sites soon followed once I'd figured out how to put my creations onlineâ€”[GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities), anyone?

In the 20-something years since, I've seen plenty of web technologies rise and fall but I continue to strive to stay up-to-date with the many languages, frameworks and best practices that make up the modern web. 

When I'm not writing code or re-writing dotfiles, I'm usually thinking about:

- :elephant: PHP
- :penguin: Linux
- :battery: Electronics
- :radio: Amateur radio
- :camera: Photography
- :car: Rallying
- :joystick: Retro games
