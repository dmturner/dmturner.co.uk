##### Me me me

Hi :wave:, I'm a freelance full-stack web developer based in Lancashire, UK.

I specialise in building easy-to-use CMS powered websites --- with a particular focus on the housing sector --- in order to drive leads and sales for my clients.

I've been making things appear on the web since 1999 when I took my first steps into web development --- if you can call it that --- by writing a few lines of HTML and making a picture appear in Internet Explorer. It was a picture of a monkey from [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_(series)) if you must know.

In the 20 years since, I've seen scores of web technologies come and go but I continue to strive to keep up-to-date with the many languages and frameworks that make up the modern web.

When I'm not writing code I'm usually watching/thinking/reading about:

- Web development :computer:
- Rallying :car:
- Photography :camera:
- Electronics :battery:
- Amateur radio :radio:

##### This website

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/). The site deploys from a [git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dmturner/dmturner.co.uk) where it's then built and hosted using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dmturner/deploys).

Continuous deployment means that I can push any changes to the repository and have Netlify automatically detect the change, build the new content and deploy the new code - usually within 30 seconds of me pushing the commits. Awesome!

All blog post content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which makes it easy to write and style content. It's also handy for making sure content is future-proof by not being tied to any particular CMS or database.

I occasionally use [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) as a way to add content to the site through a CMS, although when you're writing content in Markdown it's easy to do that from your code editor or a terminal window.
